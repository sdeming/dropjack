**DropJack** is a falling block puzzle game with a unique twist - instead of traditional Tetris blocks, you use playing cards! The objective is to create combinations of adjacent cards that sum exactly to **21** (like in Blackjack) to clear them from the board and score points.

## üéÆ Game Overview

DropJack combines the strategic card mechanics of Blackjack with the fast-paced gameplay of falling block puzzles. Cards fall from the top of the screen, and you must position them strategically to create paths of adjacent cards that sum to 21.

### Core Mechanics

- **Card Values**: Standard playing card values (Ace = 1 or 11, Face cards = 10, Numbers = face value)
- **Combination Rules**: Create paths of 2+ adjacent cards (up, down, left, right) that sum exactly to 21
- **Gravity**: When cards are cleared, remaining cards fall down to fill gaps
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Game speed increases over time
- **Scoring**: Earn points for each card cleared in combinations

### Difficulty Modes

- **Easy Mode**: Cards of any suit can be combined together
- **Hard Mode**: Only cards of the same suit can form valid combinations

## üéØ How to Play

1. **Movement**: Use arrow keys to move the falling card left/right
2. **Drop**: Press down arrow for faster drop, or space for instant hard drop
3. **Objective**: Position cards to create adjacent paths that sum to 21
4. **Strategy**: Plan ahead - longer combinations score more points!
5. **Game Over**: When cards reach the top of the board

### Controls

- `‚Üê/‚Üí` - Move card left/right
- `‚Üì` - Soft drop (faster fall)
- `Space` - Hard drop (instant placement)
- `Escape` - Pause/Menu

## üéÆ Input Support

DropJack supports both **keyboard and controller** input, with the game automatically detecting your preferred input method and displaying relevant on-screen instructions. Perfect for desktop play or handheld gaming on Steam Deck and other devices.

## üîß Technical Details

### Dependencies

- **Raylib** (5.5.1) - Graphics rendering and window management
- **rusqlite** (0.36.0) - SQLite database for high scores
- **rand** (0.9.1) - Random number generation for deck shuffling
- **chrono** (0.4.31) - Date/time handling for high score timestamps

### Key Algorithms

1. **Combination Detection**: Uses recursive pathfinding to detect all possible 21-sum paths
2. **Gravity System**: Implements realistic card falling with smooth animations
3. **Collision Detection**: Checks valid card placement and movement boundaries
4. **State Management**: Clean separation between game logic and rendering

### Architecture Highlights

- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns across modules
- **Entity-Component Pattern**: Cards have both logical and visual position components
- **Event-Driven Updates**: Game state changes trigger appropriate visual effects
- **Database Abstraction**: Clean interface for high score persistence
- **Smooth Animations**: Visual positions interpolate smoothly to logical positions
